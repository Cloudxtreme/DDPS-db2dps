# How to install the development environment

  - Install virtualbox
  - Create a Ubuntu 16.04.2 server
  - On the host, run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netson/ubuntu-unattended/master/create-unattended-iso.sh`
  - Remaster as needed
  - Run mk-ddps-dev-hw.sh (will remove existing ddps-dev!)
  - copy with rsync.sh
