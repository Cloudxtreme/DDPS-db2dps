Rules seems to have *customernetworkid* as part of their properties; I think
this must be an error and it should be replaced by customerid.

When creating automatic rules it doesn't make sence to have one
customernetworkid (which describes one network) as fastnetmon may protect
multible networks.

Would a change to the database schema for the rules table brake something else?
