__DATA__

Regex may be used for both port and package length, if the upper and lower limit
for port is set to 0-65535 and for package 20-9000, see below.

## Port specification(s):

### Range:

The lowest port numer for filtering is 0, while the largest port number is an
unsigned short 2^16-1: 65535, as specified in RFC 793. Port 0 which is not a
valid port may be set in a UDP or TCP package and transported 'over the wire',
see [Port Authority Database, Port 0](https://www.grc.com/port_0.htm)

### Filter specification(s):

For each rule only one of the following syntaxes are allowed:

  - **range**: _lower boundary_ - _upper boundary_, e.g. `=80-8080`
  - **any combination of**: `=port =port >=port <=port ...` e.g. `=80 =443 <=1023`

The `&` sign is not accepted by Juniper: it breaks the BGP sesstion.

You may not specify both a range and something else.

## Package length specification(s):

Here the length of an IP datagram is messured, so the range is between 20 and
65535 (bytes).

### Range:

Size of Ethernet frame - 24 Bytes
Size of IPv4 Header (without any options) - 20 bytes
Size of TCP Header (without any options) - 20 Bytes
So total size of empty TCP datagram - 24 + 20 + 20 = 64 bytes

Size of UDP header - 8 bytes
So total size of empty UDP datagram - 24 + 20 + 8 = 52 bytes

But I think you can create an empty IP frame with 20 bytes

The maximum size of an IP datagram is 65535 bytes while jumbo frames
may be 9038 bytes long [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo_frame).

I don't think we should impose an upper limit.

### Filter specification(s):

  - **range**: _lower boundary_ - _upper boundary_, e.g. `=20-9000`
  - **any combination of**: `=length =length >=length <=length ...` e.g. `=348 =512 >=1470`
